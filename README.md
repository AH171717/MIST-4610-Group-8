# Problem Description(Placeholder):
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive relational database that supports the core operations of our micro-loan provision business. This database will be pivotal in managing the intricate details of loan applications, customer information, loan disbursement, payment tracking, and comprehensive reporting. Additionally, it will support our risk assessment models, manage user accounts for both customers and employees, and facilitate secure financial transactions.
