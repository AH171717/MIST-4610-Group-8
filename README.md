# Problem Description(Placeholder):
Our database must handle a variety of operations, including loan application processing, customer management, loan disbursement, payments tracking, and reporting. It should support our risk assessment models, manage user accounts (both customers and employees), and handle financial transactions securely. Additionally, the database should allow for scalability and future integration with external financial systems.
